```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

```bash
npm install
```

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
DAO_ADDRESS=your_dao_address  # Optional, defaults to deployer
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key  # For contract verification
```

### 2. Deploy UnifiedMerchantOperations

```bash
# Deploy to localhost/hardhat network
npx hardhat run deploy-unified-merchant.cjs --network localhost

# Deploy to testnet (e.g., Avalanche Fuji)
npx hardhat run deploy-unified-merchant.cjs --network avalanche-testnet

# Deploy to mainnet
npx hardhat run deploy-unified-merchant.cjs --network mainnet
```

The deployment script will:
- ✅ Deploy `UnifiedMerchantOperations` (upgradeable)
- ✅ Deploy `EscrowConfigurationManager`
- ✅ Deploy `EscrowDeploymentFactory`
- ✅ Configure default chains and fees
- ✅ Set up proper role permissions
- ✅ Deploy migration manager (if old contract exists)
- ✅ Save deployment configuration

### 3. Run Compatibility Tests

```bash
# Test escrow system integration
npx hardhat run test-escrow-compatibility.cjs --network localhost
```

The test will verify:
- ✅ Merchant registration with enhanced features
- ✅ Escrow creation through factory
- ✅ Cross-chain support
- ✅ Reputation system
- ✅ Payment method management
- ✅ KYC verification
- ✅ Treasury operations
- ✅ Migration compatibility

### 4. Migration (if upgrading from SimpleMerchantOperations)

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

```javascript
// In Hardhat console
const migrationManager = await ethers.getContractAt("MerchantMigrationManager", "MIGRATION_MANAGER_ADDRESS");

// Initialize migration
await migrationManager.initializeMigration();

// Migrate in batches (recommended batch size: 10-20)
await migrationManager.migrateBatch(10, { value: ethers.parseEther("1.0") });

// Check progress
const progress = await migrationManager.getMigrationProgress();
console.log("Migration progress:", progress);
```

## 🔧 Key Integration Points

### For EscrowDeploymentFactory

The factory already works with the new contract through the `IMerchantOperations` interface:

```solidity
// ✅ These calls work unchanged
merchantOperations.isMerchantRegistered(merchantId)
merchantOperations.getMerchantIdByOwner(owner)
merchantOperations.linkEscrow(merchantId, escrowAddress, chain)
merchantOperations.isAuthorizedForMerchant(caller, merchantId)

// 🆕 New validation features
merchantOperations.validateEscrowCreation(merchantId, chain, token)
merchantOperations.getMerchantProfile(merchantId)
```

### For Frontend Integration

```javascript
// ✅ All existing SimpleMerchantOperations calls work
// 🆕 Plus new enhanced features:

// Get comprehensive merchant profile
const profile = await unifiedContract.getMerchantProfile(merchantId);

// Check payment methods
const paymentMethods = await unifiedContract.getMerchantPaymentMethods(merchantId);

// Validate escrow creation
const [isValid, reason] = await unifiedContract.validateEscrowCreation(merchantId, "ethereum", "USDC");

// Check regional info
const [region, stakeAmount, kycVerified] = await unifiedContract.getMerchantRegionalInfo(merchantId);
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Fails**
   - Check ETH balance for stake payments
   - Verify merchant data in old contract
   - Run migration in smaller batches

2. **Escrow Creation Fails**
   - Verify merchant is approved and KYC verified
   - Check chain is supported in merchant's region
   - Ensure sufficient deployment fee

3. **Role Permission Errors**
   - Verify correct roles are granted
   - Check if DAO address is set correctly
   - Ensure proper initialization

### Support Contacts
